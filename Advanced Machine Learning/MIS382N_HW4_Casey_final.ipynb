However, having an idea of what the distribution looks like could help one come up with a smart data transformation trick that could make the optimal decision boundary become (near) linear in the transformed space. In this question, you are given 2-dimensional data, and each data point belongs to either class 0 or class 1. \n",

Sklearn has a very nice [utility](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.classification_report.html) that helps compute the precision, recall, accuracy and F1-scores. \n",

The codebase has 3 methods in which they generate counterfactuals - random sampling, KD-tree and genetic algorithm. \n",

        "2. Report the following metrics for each of the datasets and each of the models. \n",
